    "In this analysis, I will investigate the following question associated with this collection of Disney datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTION:**  Which person (actor or director) has had the greatest financial impact on Disney revenues. This is interesting because Disney has different revenue streams and I would be interested to see which Disney animated movie(s) and therefore which actor/director is most impactful. I would expect the people associated with a blockbuster movie such as **The Lion King** to have had the most impact.\n",

    "The datasets were obtained from the [website](https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16) [1] and the following quote is from [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios_films) [2].\n",

Each table is stored in a `.csv` file and contains different information about Disney animated characters, movies, actors, directors and Disney corporate revenues. I will use the `disney_movies_total_gross.csv`,  `disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv`, `disney-director.csv`, and `disney-voice-actors.csv` tables formally described below:\n",
    "\n",

    "    * This file contains financial information on Disney corporate revenue between 1991 and 2016, including the year, revenue from the Studio Entertainment division, revenue from the Consumer Products division, revenue from the Disney Interactive division, revenue from Parks & Resorts, and revenue from Disney Media Networks.\n",

    "The biggest limitation to this analysis is that the datasets for actors and directors only include Disney Animation movies and do not include other Disney properties such as **Star Wars Ep. VII: The Force Awakens**. Consequently, if a non Disney Animation movies is a huge hit, the total movie gross will be larger for that year and the fraction attributed to the Disney Animation movie will be skewed.  Having additional data with actors and directors for all Disney movies would be an improvement."
